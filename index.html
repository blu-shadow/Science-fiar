    <h2>For Participants (Students)</h2>
    
    <h3>What is a Science Fair?</h3>
    <p>A science fair is a dynamic educational event where students showcase their creativity, problem-solving skills, and scientific knowledge through independent research projects. Participants engage in the scientific method, design experiments, analyze results, and present their findings. Beyond just experiments, science fairs cultivate critical thinking, innovation, and communication skills that are vital for academic and personal growth. Students gain exposure to real-world applications of science, build confidence, and develop a passion for inquiry-based learning.</p>
    <p>Participating in a science fair allows students to delve deeply into subjects they are curious about, explore various branches of science and technology, and present their discoveries to an audience of peers, teachers, judges, and community members. It encourages students to step outside of textbook learning and engage with science in a meaningful, hands-on way. Students often find that participating in science fairs fosters resilience, creativity, and a lifelong love of discovery.</p>

    <h3>Getting Started</h3>
    <p>Choosing a project can be both exciting and daunting. Here’s a step-by-step approach to help you get started:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Find Your Interest:</strong> Think about topics that fascinate you — whether it's space, chemistry, technology, or the environment.</li>
        <li><strong>Formulate a Question:</strong> Good science projects start with a clear, testable question.</li>
        <li><strong>Develop a Hypothesis:</strong> Predict what you think will happen during your experiment.</li>
        <li><strong>Plan and Conduct Experiments:</strong> Design a step-by-step plan to test your hypothesis.</li>
        <li><strong>Collect Data:</strong> Carefully record your results, making observations and measurements.</li>
        <li><strong>Analyze and Interpret:</strong> Look for patterns, summarize findings, and determine whether your hypothesis was supported.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Project Ideas & Inspiration</h3>
    <p>Need ideas? Here are a few:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Biology:</strong> Studying the effects of different fertilizers on plant growth.</li>
        <li><strong>Chemistry:</strong> Testing natural pH indicators using vegetables like red cabbage.</li>
        <li><strong>Physics:</strong> Investigating the best materials for thermal insulation.</li>
        <li><strong>Environmental Science:</strong> Designing an efficient water filtration system using natural materials.</li>
        <li><strong>Technology:</strong> Building a basic robot using Arduino kits.</li>
    </ul>
    Inspiration can come from daily life, nature, problems you notice, or things you love!</p>

    <h3>The Scientific Method</h3>
    <p>The scientific method is a systematic way of learning about the world:
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Observation:</strong> Notice something interesting.</li>
        <li><strong>Question:</strong> Ask a specific, testable question.</li>
        <li><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> Make an educated guess about what will happen.</li>
        <li><strong>Experiment:</strong> Test your hypothesis under controlled conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Record the results of your experiment.</li>
        <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Review the data to find patterns.</li>
        <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> State what you learned and whether your hypothesis was correct.</li>
    </ol>
    Mastering the scientific method will sharpen your thinking and open new ways to approach problems in every part of life!</p>
